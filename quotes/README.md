"I think that I shall never see
A graph more lovely than a tree.
A tree whose crucial property
Is loop-free connectivity.
A tree which must be sure to span.
So packets can reach every LAN.
First the Root must be selected
By ID it is elected.
Least cost paths from Root are traced
In the tree these paths are placed.
A mesh is made by folks like me
Then bridges find a spanning tree."
Algorhyme by Radia Perlman
```

```
"A system is a big black box
Of which we can’t unlock the locks, 
And all we can find out about
Is what goes in and what comes out.
Perceiving input-output pairs, 
Related by parameters,
Permits us, sometimes, to relate 
An input, output and a state.
If this relation’s good and stable 
Then to predict we may be able, 
But if this fails us—heaven forbid! 
We’ll be compelled to force the lid!"
Kenneth Boulding
